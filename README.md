In today's society, the coronavirus plagues the globe. As much as direct mitigation of the such a pandemic is crucial, what's more important is both the prevention and control over another pandemic similar to the novel coronavirus. CoronaSim aims to provide a streamlined means to simulate a pathogen with sophisticated, yet adaptive, technology.

CoronaSim essentially simulates a modern city with the use of hidden nodes and agents. Several features have been added so the user can customize what type of environment and factors the simulation is conducted on. This allows the user to see the effects of demographic factors as well as preventative measures on infection rates, such as quarantining a building. The user can also analyze the simulation in real-time with a graph to gain a better understanding of the correlation between infected and recovered.
